<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Hi there!</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Thank you so much for RSVPing to our meeting!</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">We're trying to get as many people to come to the meeting as possible, both to gauge the interest in the community and to tell everyone about the great benefits of coworking, like increased productivity, a sense of community, and a unique office culture.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">In between now and the meeting on April 13th, there are a few things you can do to participate:</p>


<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px"><strong>Join our mailing list and facebook group!</strong><br />
Keep the conversation going online and keep up with our events offline! Sign up for our newsletter and join our facebook group through our website, <a href="http://fayettevillecoworking.com">fayettevillecoworking.com.</a></li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 15px"><strong>Tell your friends and colleagues!</strong><br /> We're looking for anyone who can choose the location where they work, some or all of the time. This can be people who are entrepreneurs, self-employed, consultants, small business owners, and even those who work remotely for a company full-time. Do you know anyone else in the area who might be interested? We’d love it if you shared a link to the Eventbrite with them, which is <a href="https://eventbrite.com/event/16002105729">https://eventbrite.com/event/16002105729</a>. Tag your friends on Facebook or send them an email!</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 30px"><strong>Cowork with us now!</strong> <br />This is a great way to see first hand if coworking is a fit for you and to get to know other members of our new community. We meet every Tuesday from 10am-2pm at Starbucks on Ramsey Street in Fayetteville, and every Thursday from 10am-2pm at Detour Coffee House on Camden Road in Hope Mills. No RSVP or commitment required, just bring your laptop and stay for as long as you’d like.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">Please let us know if you have any questions or comments! You can reply directly to this email. Thanks again for your interest, and we can’t wait to meet you on April 13th.</p>
