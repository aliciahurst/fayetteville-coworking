			<p>Your home office might be cozy, but we bet you're not getting the best business advice from your dog. 
					Even if you leave the house to work from a coffee shop, it isn't that much better than working by yourself. 
					The goal is to be more productive and happy than we would be working alone, and we can celebrate that productivity at 
					the end of each day.</p>
					<h2>What is coworking?</h2>
					<p>
					Coworking is a community for independent workers and small teams – this can be people who are entrepreneurs, 
					self-employed, consultants, small business owners, and even those who work for a company full-time, but can choose the location 
					where they work, some or all of the time. </p>
					<p>We come together to create a unique office culture, and reap all of the productivity, 
					efficiency, and health benefits associated with it. Coworking combines a shared working environment 
					(like an office space) and independent activity, and in addition to fostering creativity and cross-industry 
					collaboration, it helps combat the isolation and distractions that often comes with working alone at home or in a coffee shop.
